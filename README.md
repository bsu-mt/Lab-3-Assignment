# Sheep on the Web - Project Overview

## Synopsis

Our entire project tells the story of a dangerous “sheep on the web”. In our episode, the sheep magically appears on camera in different parts of the world, and depending on its mood, it chooses to do nothing, politely leave, or explode and cause danger. Our whole story is about introducing the audience to the characteristics of this dangerous sheep and warning them to stay away from it.

In our project video, we show in detail what our project is about. The first part of our story shows how the sheep reacts (i.e. snow and fireworks in the first sighting video) and how the sheep reacts when it is in a good mood (i.e. it politely leaves in the second sighting report). The second part of our story shows how the sheep reacts when it is angry (i.e. the witness is blown up in the third sighting report).

## How the Project Was Made

In the folder corresponding to each of our members, we showed what each made and how the work was done. Overall, all of us completed development using Unity. Please go to each of our individual folders to see our project details, demos, and notes.

## Group Work

Each of the three of us completed our own part of the development and explained the project process. Zirui Lin was responsible for completing the outline README you see here.
